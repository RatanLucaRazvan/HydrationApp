# HydrationApp
# This app helps the user track his daily licquid consumption
The app works in the following way:
- The user has three container sizes through which he can add his licquid intake, and one container size through which he can decrease the intake
- Also, there is a history screen available for the user that helps him see the licquid intake statistics for the last 30 days
- Moreover, the user has the possiblity to change the units(ounces or milliliters), the goal, and the container sizes
